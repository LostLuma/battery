Battery
=======

Java 8+ JNI bindings to the [starship battery](https://crates.io/crates/starship-battery) crate.

Usage
-----

The library can be installed from the `releases` repository on [maven.lostluma.net](https://maven.lostluma.net/#/releases/net/lostluma/battery).

The dynamic library is currently available for Linux (amd64), MacOS (aarch64, amd64), and Windows (amd64).  
When first used the corresponding version for your system will be downloaded, validated, and cached for subsequent uses.

Misc
----

This is my first time using both Rust and JNI :)
